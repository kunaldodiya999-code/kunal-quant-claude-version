# Claude change log

Short, append-only record of what Claude changed, so every AI and the owner can see the state.
Newest entry first. Test counts are real runs; "needs local DB" errors/skips are the 5 candle-database tests.

## claude/session-controls (on top of claude/paper-restart-recovery)
- Added `paper_trading/controls.py`: entry window, daily realised-loss cap, forced exit, kill switch.
  Defaults 09:45 / 15:00 / 15:10 IST are CANDIDATES from the handover, not approved values.
- Kill switch persists in `controls_state.json` and fails closed if the file is unreadable.
  `HaltMode.BLOCK_ENTRIES` keeps managing open positions; `HaltMode.FLATTEN` closes them.
- Added `PaperTradingEngine.force_close` (reuses the existing END_OF_DATA reason; locked lifecycle untouched).
- Coordinator takes optional `controls`; session builds them from `PaperSessionConfig`.
- Tests: 10 new. Suite (TZ=Asia/Kolkata): 354 passed, 5 need local DB.
- Limits: daily loss is realised gross P&L only (no costs, no mark-to-market). Nothing calls
  `close_due_positions` on a timer yet: the runner must supply prices and call it.
- Added `scripts/apply_claude_patch.ps1` (apply patch on a new branch, test, push if green).

## claude/paper-restart-recovery
- Added `paper_trading/recovery.py`: rebuild open positions and seen signals from the journal.
- Tests: 11 new. Suite: 344 passed, 5 need local DB.
